# python-challenge
The purpose of this project is to automate the analysis of large datasets of financial (PyBank) and ballot (PyPoll) data using Python.  The code used allows for any size of data (except for a minimum required amount as indicated below).  Results from the scripts provides screen and file outputs.

# PyBank
The code created for the PyBank / financial analysis project provides a summary of the following:
  - Total months reviewed
  - Total profits
  - Average month-over-month change in profits/losses
  - Month with the greatest increase in profits from the prior month and the amount change and
  - Month with the greatest decrease in profits from the prior month and the amount change

Script location: https://github.com/acdlc4/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Script/main.py
Output location: https://github.com/acdlc4/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/analysis/FinReview.txt
Limitations: Requires at least two subsequent months of data for the minimum amount of analysis and the script to operate successfully.

# PyPoll
The code created for the PyPoll / ballot analysis project provides a summary of the following:
  - Total votes counted
  - Summary of all candidates with their respective
      - Vote percentages and
      - Votes received
  - Overall winner

Script location: https://github.com/acdlc4/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/Script/main.py
Output location: https://github.com/acdlc4/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/analysis/ElectionResults.txt
Limitations: Requires at least one ballot for the script to operate successfully.
